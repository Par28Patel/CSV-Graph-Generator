Academically, there's no question. It's no different than getting someone else to write your assignment. But beyond academics it's harder to say. From my understanding, ChatGPT analyzes preexisting written work and synthesizes a new piece of writing from what it's analyzed. This leaves the question of credit, since all component pieces were originally someone else's. With the way intellectual property is handled right now, that's theft.

Additionally, ChatGPT fills a niche that doesn't really need to be filled, at least as it currently exists. People want to be writers, and there are already not enough jobs for them. If ChatGPT got instigated into other bots to create a more effective and seamless human-computer interaction, that would be fantastic. However, as tool to fill in words rather than having to write them yourself, it's immoral and often unhelpful."

If we were to let students who know virtually nothing about the work in their field, their work will be flawed and wrong and no good work will be done. Id a doctor were to cheat on all their assignments then graduate and be hired as a doctor, they would no nothing about treating a patient and put peoples lives at risk."
